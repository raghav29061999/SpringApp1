# --> ./mvnw clean package
    Typically used to clean package when we want to build our project and generate an artifact without running
    the integration tests. This gives us a jar file, which we can then run using the below command and test the code

# Navigate to directory where it is created and then execute command -->
    java -jar <name of jar file>
    to stop execution press "ctrl+C"


# --> ./mvnw clean verify
    Use clean verify for more comprehensive testing and validation, including running integration tests,
    before deploying or releasing our project.
