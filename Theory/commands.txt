#--> ./mvnw clean
    clears the target folder. Target directory is where maven puts all of it's process, artifacts and everything

#--> ./mvnw compile
    This command will use the Maven Wrapper (./mvnw) to compile the source code of the project.

#--> ./mvnw test
    This command will use the Maven Wrapper (./mvnw) to execute the tests defined in the project.

#--> ./mvnw package
    Will generate the jar files. This command will use the Maven Wrapper to package the project according to the
    configuration specified in the pom.xml file.

#--> ./mvnw verify
    This command runs Maven's verify phase, executing compilation, running tests, and performing additional checks
    specified in the project configuration, using the Maven Wrapper (./mvnw).

# --> ./mvnw clean package
    Typically used to clean package when we want to build our project and generate an artifact without running
    the integration tests. This gives us a jar file, which we can then run using the below command and test the code

# Navigate to directory where it is created and then execute command -->
    java -jar <name of jar file>
    to stop execution press "ctrl+C"


# --> ./mvnw clean verify
    Use clean verify for more comprehensive testing and validation, including running integration tests,
    before deploying or releasing our project.
