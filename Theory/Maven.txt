Maven - It is a build automation tool primarily used for java projects. It is used for managing java project
        dependencies, building, testing, packaging, and deploying java based applications. Maven uses Project
        object Model file to describe the project configurations and dependencies.

Maven has three phases:
    |                                                   |   Pre Clean - Hook before Cleaning
    | Clean : Removes temporary directory and file      |   Clean - Does the actual cleaning
    |                                                   |   Post Clean - Hook after cleaning

    |           | compile - Compiles your code to byte code
    |           | test - Runs unit test
    | Default : Where the most useful goal live. * Maven default phase is lifecycle. Compile before test, test before package,verify
    |           | package - creates a jar or war file
    |           | verify - Runs and checks integration tests
