Auto Configuration -  In Spring Boot, when you include dependencies in your pom.xml file and provide configurations/
properties, Spring Boot automatically configures and creates beans based on sensible defaults and conventions. This
feature is known as "auto-configuration" and is one of the key benefits of using Spring Boot.




Modularity - refers to the ability to divide your application into smaller, self-contained modules or components.
These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, making it easier to manage large and complex
applications.

Inversion of Control :

Problem Statement: You have a class that depends on three other classes to achieve its functionality.

Traditional Approach: Initially, you might create instances of these dependent classes inside your original class using
    the new keyword. However, this tightly couples your class with its dependencies, making it difficult to change them
    later without modifying the original class.

Improved Approach: Instead of creating instances directly within the original class, you declare interfaces for these
    dependencies. This allows your class to interact with these dependencies through their interfaces rather than
    specific implementations.

Introduction of a Framework: To provide concrete implementations of these dependencies, you introduce a framework that
    handles the creation and injection of these dependencies. This framework follows the principle of dependency
    injection, where it injects the dependencies into your class at runtime.

Inversion of Control (IoC): By introducing the framework and allowing it to manage the creation and injection of
    dependencies, the control over the instantiation and management of these dependencies shifts from your original
    class to the framework. This shift of control is termed as Inversion of Control (IoC).

Benefits of IoC: With IoC, your original class becomes more flexible and loosely coupled with its dependencies. If you
    need to change or replace a dependency, you can do so without modifying the original class. The framework handles
    the instantiation and injection of the new dependency, promoting better maintainability and extensibility of your
    codebase.
